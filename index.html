    <div class="container">
    <p>During the evening of Nov. 30, an explosion erupted in a Cypress Hills building, displacing 58 people (who made up to 19 families,) and injured six residents. Two weeks later, the residents still feel uncertain about what the immediate future holds for them, even after being relocated to local shelters. </p>

<p>According to a public statement by the New York City Fire Department, the explosion brought 138 firefighters to the scene and caused additional damage to the homes nearby and behind the building. Deputy Chief Patrick Sheridan stated that the injuries were “non-life-threatening.” </p>

<p>The American Red Cross and the New York City Office of Emergency Management helped place the residents in nearby hotels, before they were sent to two shelters from the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, one in Williamsburg and the other in South Brooklyn.</p>

<p>However, the process to place them in these shelters was not simple. According to multiple members from the Cypress Hills Local Development Corporation, an organization that was heavily involved in supporting the residents during the relocation process, the Department of Housing Preservation failed to treat the situation carefully.</p>

<p>“They were not compassionate about what they just went through,” said Foreclosure Prevention Counselor Rosalinda Gutierrez. She stated that the Department told the residents that they needed to fill out certain documents to be put in local shelters and didn’t offer any help or accommodations for residents who were struggling to do so in time.</p>

<p>Gutierrez also said that they were communicating with the tenants “in a rude way,” adding: “We’re supposed to be there to support them and alleviate their pain and they didn’t do that, so that’s where we came in.” She said that her corporation “communicated with HPD so that they [residents] didn’t have to get that horrible attention.”</p>

<p>Working alongside Executive Assistant Rosemarie Maldonado and Executive Director Michelle Neugebauer, Gutierrez helped the tenants put together the documentation and sent it to the Department. All three members expressed frustration that the Department sent an intake form to the tenants the day after their initial contact, delayed the shelter placement. </p>

<p>Most residents were accepted and given housing, except for two people, who were denied and are still in local hotels while the corporation continues to help them. However, tenants have expressed to the organization and the office of New York State Senator Julia Salazar that they don’t know what will come next.</p>

<p>“They’re still lost,” said Gutierrez after stating that neither the residents nor her organization have any certainty about how long they will be given shelter or if there will be any aid in their search for long-term housing. </p>

<p>Amidst all this, Josepsh Yuzef, the building’s landlord, remained absent. The local development corporation stated that many tenants tried to call the landlord the following day but didn’t get a response. </p>

<p>According to a statement from Senator Salazar, a tenant had reached out to the landlord hours before the explosion and stated that he smelled a gas leak, to which Yuzef responded that this was being taken care of. Despite multiple attempts to speak with him, we were not able to connect with him either by phone or email.</p>

<p>Neugebauer and Gutierrez stressed that the fire didn’t only damage the tenants’ homes and properties. They confirmed that two families had lost their cats in the fire, which they had lived with since they were kittens. </p>

<p>Two other tenants had businesses that they conducted from their home, therefore losing their main source of income. Other residents are elderly and retired and they have expressed that they won’t be able to get an apartment in the near future.</p>

<p>The office of Senator Salazar and the LDC came together to manage operations moving forward and continue to assist residents over the holidays, specifically to help them find more long-term options. They also helped set up GoFundMe virtual fundraisers, whose funds will be managed by the corporation.</p>
